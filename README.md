# __about:blank__
It is recommended to try using this game on the about:blank page as it has literally nothing in it. Or try using a javascript playground thingy. Idk. Pick your thingy.

# __NODE.JS__
If you wish to run this on your personal computer, install node.js and open the terminus.js file with it.
